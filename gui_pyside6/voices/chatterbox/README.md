# Chatterbox demo voices

These audio files were included in the https://github.com/rsxdalv/TTS-WebUI repository for testing Chatterbox-TTS.

Place Chatterbox-compatible voice files here (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.aac`).

This folder is scanned at runtime by `list_voices()` once Chatterbox is installed.

If you want to add your own voices, place them here.

_Note: They are not part of the official Chatterbox package._
